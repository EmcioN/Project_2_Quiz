 [Shantell Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shantell+Sans) I will use this font in name of the quiz. Shantell Sans is a marker-style font built for creative expression that is why i like it.
#### Icons
 I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons because they're easy to use and look great. After adding them to the site, it became livelier and more attractive. Thanks to them, the website is easier to read. They are easy to understand, so they replace some descriptions.
